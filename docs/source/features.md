# Feature Selection Algorithms
--------------------
The following feature selection algorithms are available:
- **Chi2**: Chi-squared stats of non-negative features for classification tasks
- **Pearson**: Pearson correlation coefficient between label/feature for regression tasks
- **ROTS**: (only available if ROTS was run in the previous step) Reproducibility optimized test statistic (ROTS) for RNA-seq data

Once the feature selection algorithms are selected, the algorithm runs using the defaults and the results for each method is shown in a table. The parameters for each method can be changed by clicking on the "Set advanced parameters" checkbox. 

The final table that contains all the selections from all the methods can be obtained by selecting the desired methods and clicking on the ---- button.
